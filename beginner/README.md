##Summary of Lessons

###IAmCool

When I as a 13-year old, I was given a computer.  Very slowly I taught myself to program.
At that age, it was thrilling to have the computer print out "Rob is Cool!".  And it still 
is.  The first exercise is use javascript (with node) to have the computer write out
"YOURNAME is Cool!" as many times as you want.

###IAmCoolAlert 

Although recent browsers provide powerfully debugging tools, it is critical for beginners
to understand how to debug **by modifiying the code**.  The most basic way of doing this
with the "Alert" message and "console.log". 

###IAmCoolWeb 

But using alerts gets boring.  More sophisitcated is to add "I am Cool" to the web page
directly.
