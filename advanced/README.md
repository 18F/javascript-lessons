#Functional Programming with Javascript


Remember how Jack's mother asked him to sell their 
cow to get money to buy food, but he traded his cow for some magic beans, which
turned out to be a pretty good deal?

I can't really teach you advanced javascript, because I don't know it.

But I can teach you something far more important---the Deep Magic 
for the Dawn of Time---**functional programming**.

This is my feeble attempt to teach you the deepest magic I know.

##Preparation

Install [node](http://nodejs.org)

npm install node
npm install -g mocha


##Summary of Lessons

###Fold

One of the greatest contributions of the functional programming community
to *all* programming is one of the simplest.  Google made it famous 
in the form of *map reduce*.

The first exercise is to write [fold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)).

###Map

**Map** is in a way simpler than **fold**.  Map is a function which takes an arbitrary unary 
function and applies it to every element of an array.

###TenExamplesOfFold

Write ten realistic and valuable examples of *fold*.  You may use *map* in these examples.

###LeftVsRight

Find a realistic example that proves that foldl is not the same as foldr.
